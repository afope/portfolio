# portfolio website
a fully responsive website that displays my portfolio and a list of projects i've worked on

## installation
* you should first download MAMP/WAMP
* (this website was written with html and css)
* to copy the project on your computer, open your terminal and run this: [git clone](https://github.com/afope/portfolio.git) e.g $ `git clone <remote repo> <repo name>`
* you will find the **remote repo** link above by clicking on the green *"clone or download"* option in tab above the repository
* then run `cd <repo name>` in your terminal ()*<repo name>* is whatever name you gave your repository in the terminal)
* this should open up the folder you just cloned from github
* open up your MAMP or WAMP, which was downloaded in step one above
* on your computer, navigate to the folder you just cloned by going to *file* and then clicking *open*
* inside the folder, open the two files, *index.html* and *style.css* which is inside the css folder.  
* once you open your local server (MAMP/WAMP) then you can run the files on your local machine and the website would open up.  

## usage
* there are two main files, the index.html file, which contains the markup of the webpage and then the style.css file which contains all the styling for the webpage.
* open the index.html file in your browser to see the webpage.
